# Custom Percent Complete for Clarity
This package makes possible to exclude tasks from the project % complete calculation and lets customers create their own calculation methods and formulas.

# Business Reason
Several customers create "dummy" tasks on project schedules just to process financial transactions or to post timesheets. The problem is that these tasks generally have a huge impact on the Project % Complete. This package allows customers to exclude these tasks from the % Complete calculation and also makes easier to add their very own calculation methods.

# Considerations
The release 1.0 implements the custom calculation by duration only.
The package is available in two languages: English and Brazilian Portuguese

For more details on how to install, configure and use, please see the package documentation.

# Custom Percent Complete for Clarity
This package makes possible to exclude tasks from the project % complete calculation and lets customers create their own calculation methods and formulas.

## Business Reason
Several customers create "dummy" tasks on project schedules just to process financial transactions or to post timesheets. The problem is that these tasks generally have a huge impact on the Project % Complete. This package allows customers to exclude these tasks from the % Complete calculation and also makes easier to add their very own calculation methods.

## Release Notes
- This release was tested in multiple environments
- This release implements the custom calculation by duration only
- This release is available in two languages: English and Brazilian Portuguese
